# Earthquake Tracking Dashboard Streamlit

In this project raw earthquake data is being visualised using a dashboard using the streamlit ecosystem of application generation.

# Overview

## Context
The client has requested an earthquake tracking dashboard for insight generation from 30 days of global Earthquake data. The client requested that:

- It must have a map showing where Earthquakes took place, and this also needs to show their magnitude.
- It must have a list of the top 10 biggest earthquakes.
- It must have a breakdown of the percentage of earthquakes that occurred, by broad location.
- For more granular locations, it must show how many earthquakes took place, the average magnitude and the maximum magnitude.
We need all these elements on one dashboard so that we can easily see patterns. They all need to be attached to the same date filter, where we can track earthquakes day by day, and have the ability to scroll through the data one day at a time.
